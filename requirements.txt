# --- Core AI / ML Libraries ---
openai-whisper==20240930          # For speech transcription
torch>=2.2.0,<3.0.0               # PyTorch (check compatibility with CUDA if GPU is used)
torchaudio~=2.2.0                 # For audio processing with PyTorch
torchvision~=0.17.0               # For vision models with PyTorch

# For YOLO object detection (Ultralytics is a common choice for recent YOLO versions)
ultralytics~=8.3.153

# For BLIP image captioning and other transformer-based models
transformers~=4.50.2              # Hugging Face Transformers
# timm==0.9.12                    # Often a dependency for vision transformers, may be pulled by transformers

# --- Video and Audio Processing ---
opencv-python-headless~=4.9.0.80  # OpenCV for video frame extraction (headless is good for CLI/servers)
# ffmpeg-python==0.2.0            # If using ffmpeg directly via this wrapper for audio extraction
moviepy~=1.0.3                    # Alternative for video/audio operations, might pull ffmpeg itself

# --- Ollama Client ---
ollama~=0.1.8                     # Official Ollama Python client

# --- PANNs Audio Event Detection Dependencies (Example) ---
# These might vary based on the specific PANNs implementation used.
# Often PANNs implementations require specific versions or additional libraries like:
# librosa==0.10.1
# sed_eval==0.2.1
# soundfile==0.12.1

# --- Utilities (Optional, depending on your implementation) ---
# PyYAML==6.0.1                   # If you decide to use YAML for complex configurations
# python-dotenv==1.0.0            # If you use .env files for managing environment-specific settings
loguru==0.7.2                     # Modern logging library

# --- Ensure specific versions for reproducibility ---
# Add any other specific libraries identified during development below.
# For example, if a specific version of numpy or Pillow is crucial:
numpy~=1.26.4
Pillow~=10.3.0
